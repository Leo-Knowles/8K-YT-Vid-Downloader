Its Simple Just Download The File And Open It!!
Also If You Open It Windows Will Probably Say Windows Protected Ur Pc But Thats Cuz Its Not A Signed App ( Wich You Have to pay To get It Signed Just To Stop 1 pop-up )
This App Was Originally A Python Script But I Used PyInstaller To Turn It Into A EXE File So I Think You Can use It On Macs If You Download The Python Script And Install Python You Might Be Able To Run It But I've Not Tested It Yet
